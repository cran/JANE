\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of S3 \code{\link{class}} "\code{JANE}", a result of a call to \code{JANE}.}

\item{type}{A character string to select the type of plot:
\itemize{
\item{'lsnc': plot the network using the estimated latent positions and color-code actors by cluster (default)}
\item{'misclassified': (can only be used if \code{true_labels} is \code{!NULL}) similar to 'lsnc', but will color misclassified actors in black}
\item{'uncertainty': similar to 'lsnc', but here the color gradient applied represents the actor-specific classification uncertainty}
\item{'trace_plot': presents various trace plots across the iterations of the EM algorithm}
}}

\item{true_labels}{(optional) A numeric, character, or factor vector of known true cluster labels. Must have the same length as number of actors in the fitted network. Need to account for potential isolates removed.}

\item{initial_values}{A logical; if \code{TRUE} then plots fit using the starting parameters used in the EM algorithm (default is \code{FALSE}, i.e., the results after the EM algorithm is run are plotted).}

\item{zoom}{A numeric value > 0 that controls the \% magnification of the plot (default is 100\%).}

\item{density_type}{Choose from one of the following three options: 'contour' (default), 'hdr', 'image', and 'persp' indicating the density plot type.}

\item{rotation_angle}{A numeric value that rotates the estimated latent positions and contours of the multivariate normal distributions clockwise (or counterclockwise if \code{swap_axes = TRUE}) through the specified angle about the origin (default is 0 degrees). Only relevant when \code{D} (i.e., dimension of the latent space) \code{>= 2} and \code{type != 'trace_plot'}.}

\item{alpha_edge}{A numeric value in \code{[0,1]} that controls the transparency of the network edges (default is 0.1).}

\item{alpha_node}{A numeric value in \code{[0,1]} that controls the transparency of the actors in the network (default is 1).}

\item{swap_axes}{A logical; if \code{TRUE} will swap the x and y axes (default is \code{FALSE}).}

\item{main}{An optional overall title for the plot.}

\item{xlab}{An optional title for the x axis.}

\item{ylab}{An optional title for the y axis.}

\item{cluster_cols}{An optional vector of colors for the clusters. Must have a length of at least \eqn{K}.}

\item{...}{Unused.}

\value{
A plot of the network or trace plot of the EM run.

S3 plot method for object of class "\code{JANE}".

\details{
The classification of actors into specific clusters is based on a hard clustering rule of \eqn{\{h | Z_{ih} = max_k Z_{ik}\}}. Additionally, the actor-specific classification uncertainty is derived as 1 - \eqn{max_k Z_{ik}}.

The trace plot contains up to five unique plots tracking various metrics across the iterations of the EM algorithm, depending on the \code{\link[JANE]{JANE}} control parameter \code{termination_rule}:
\itemize{
\item{\code{termination_rule = 'prob_mat'}: Five plots will be presented. Specifically, in the top panel, the plot on the left presents the change in the absolute difference in \eqn{\hat{Z}} (i.e., the \eqn{N \times K} cluster membership probability matrix) between subsequent iterations. The exact quantile of the absolute difference plotted are presented in parentheses and determined by the \code{\link[JANE]{JANE}} control parameter \code{quantile_diff}. For example, the default control parameter \code{quantile_diff} = 1, so the values being plotted are the max absolute difference in \eqn{\hat{Z}} between subsequent iterations. The plot on the right of the top panel presents the absolute difference in the cumulative average of the absolute change in \eqn{\hat{Z}}  and \eqn{U} (i.e., the \eqn{N \times D} matrix of latent positions) across subsequent iterations (absolute change in \eqn{\hat{Z}}  and \eqn{U}  computed in an identical manner as described above). This metric is only tracked beginning at an iteration determined by the \code{n_its_start_CA} control parameter in \code{\link[JANE]{JANE}}. Note, this plot may be empty if the EM algorithm converges before the \code{n_its_start_CA}-th iteration. Finally, the bottom panel presents ARI, NMI, and CER values comparing the classifications between subsequent iterations, respectively. Specifically, at a given iteration we determine the  classification of actors in clusters based on a hard clustering rule of \eqn{\{h | Z_{ih} = max_k Z_{ik}\}} and given these labels from two subsequent iterations, we compute and plot the ARI, NMI and CER.}
\item{\code{termination_rule = 'Q'}: Plots generated are similar to those described in the previous bullet point. However, instead of tracking the change in \eqn{\hat{Z}} over iterations, here the absolute difference in the objective function of the E-step evaluated using parameters from subsequent iterations is tracked. Furthermore, the cumulative average of the absolute change in \eqn{U} is no longer tracked.}
\item{\code{termination_rule \%in\% c('ARI', 'NMI', 'CER')}: Four plots will be presented. Specifically, the top left panel presents a plot of the absolute difference in the cumulative average of the absolute change in the specific \code{termination_rule}  employed and \eqn{U} across iterations. As previously mentioned, if the EM algorithm converges before the \code{n_its_start_CA}-th iteration then this will be an empty plot. Furthermore, the other three plots present ARI, NMI, and CER values comparing the classifications between subsequent iterations, respectively.}
